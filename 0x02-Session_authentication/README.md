## Introduction

Session authentication is a mechanism used to authenticate and manage user sessions in web applications. It involves the following steps:

1. **User Login**: Users provide their credentials (username and password) to the application.
2. **Session Creation**: Upon successful login, a session is created for the user, and a unique session ID is generated.
3. **Session Management**: The session ID is stored as a cookie in the user's browser. The server uses this session ID to identify the user's session and track their interactions.
4. **Access Control**: The server checks the session ID with each incoming request to ensure the user is authenticated and authorized to access certain resources.
5. **Session Expiry**: Sessions may have an expiry time to enhance security. Users need to reauthenticate if their session expires.

In this project, we'll implement session authentication using Python, Flask, and SQLite.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (install using `pip install Flask`)
- SQLite

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/session-authentication-python.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd session-authentication-python`

## Usage

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the database: `python setup_database.py`
5. Run the Flask application: `flask run`

## Examples

1. **User Registration**: Visit `/register` to create a new user account.
2. **User Login**: Visit `/login` to log in with your registered credentials.
3. **Protected Route**: Access the `/protected` route to see a protected page that requires authentication.
4. **Logout**: Click on the `Logout` link to end your session.

## Security Considerations

- Always hash and salt user passwords before storing them in the database.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server.
- Implement session timeout and expiration for enhanced security.
- Regularly update packages and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
