The idea of encryption is simple: data can be scrambled by a sender with an encryption key, and then unlocked by the receiver with a decryption key. Symmetric encryption means that the encryption key and decryption key are the same. This is the less effective method as the delivery of the key could be intercepted digitally. Asymmetric encryption means that the encryption key and decryption key differ. Asymmetric encryption, or public-key encryption, is accomplished with the use of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to decrypt the data.

Good encryption keys should be no smaller than 2048 bits. Keys larger than this are rarely used because of the significant computational burden; however, a key this size is good enough as it would take a normal computer 14 billions years to crack a 2048-bit certificate, and nobody has got time for that.
